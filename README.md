## Hey there <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I'm SeisCodes, a software developer based in Colombia.

I use programming languages ​​such as JavaScript, Java, and Python.

I like learning new things and improving the knowledge I already have.

This is a fresh profile. I'll be uploading small projects, experiments, and things I'm working on.
